However, to beat my paranoia, finally pressed the button to post this online. Till now I told you why I did not blog, so let me tell you why I'm now. All my software gigs have been predominantly backend tech, frontend was and is a grey area to me. Where to start if I want to set my foot into frontend tech? Of course the first thought that comes is, signup for a MOOC? Yes, that could help to start, but I never made any course to the end for various reasons. So next thought, how about learn while at the same time start my blog. Why not build my own website? Great! This way I can do both at the same time, a win-win. I wanted to start with a static website, rather a full blown highly fancy website using a frontend tech which is a buzz currently. While there are number ways to build and host a static website online, I felt Jekyll(a static site generator) is kind of what I want to start with. Of course there are other Jekyll equivalent, however, for now I decided go with it. One other reason is, Github pages is Jekyll aware, and I plan to host my website there. So,
