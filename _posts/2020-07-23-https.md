HTTPS is HTTP over TLS. It is at the TLS layer the cryptography magic happens. In this blog post we shall explore the server certificate validation part of the TLS handshake, basically we will see how the trust is established. As part of the TLS handshake, the server sends over its certificate to client, and the client has to validate the certificate by verifying the signature in the certificate. Typically, the client is a web browser and this validation is transparent to the user. Since I want to do this validation by hand, let's do it for [google.com](https://google.com). I'll not go into concepts of SSL certificates and the related cryptography, because a simple google search will spit out myriad web links.

So, I went to [google.com](https://google.com) from chrome browser, and when I click on the padlock in the browser url address bar, I can see the certificate details, like who is the issuer, the certificate chain, etc. As you can see from the image below, google.com's cert(short for certificate going forward) is issued(signed) by an Intermediate certificate authority, namely GTS(Google Trust Services), which is again issued by a Root certificate authority, namely GlobalSign.

Now that we have seen how the chain looks like, let's try to validate for one level, i.e. from intermediate cert to leaf cert, and the same can be done recursively to validate the intermediate certs until we reach the root cert. From google.com's cert, the signature algorithm is `SHA256WITHRSA`, which is SHA256 hash of the google.com cert's `tbsCertificate`(more on that later) component encrypted using intermediate cert's private key. To validate, first we have to decrypt the signature in google.com's cert using intermediate cert's public key. If it can't be decrypted, we can terminate the validation process because the data is not authentic. After decryption we get the SHA256 hash of `tbsCertificate`, and if it's equal to the SHA256 hash we calculate from google.comâ€™s `tbsCertificate`, then cert's integrity is confirmed; meaning google.com or someone in the middle didn't tamper the cert. So, let's get rolling.

To start with, let's get the intermediate cert's(GTS) public key and save it to a file - `intermediate-pub-key.pem`. The public key looks like below:
```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

```

Get the signature out from `google.crt` and copy it to `signature.hex`:
```
openssl x509 -in google.crt -text -noout -certopt ca_default -certopt no_validity -certopt no_serial -certopt no_subject -certopt no_extensions -certopt no_signame
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption

```
Convert signature in hex to binary:
```
xxd -r -p signature.hex signature.bin
```

Decrypt the signature:
```
openssl rsautl -verify -inkey intermediate-pub-key.pem -in signature.bin -pubin > signature-decrypted.bin
```

Parsing the decrypted signature gives the SHA256 hex:
```
openssl asn1parse -inform der -in signature-decrypted.bin
    0:d=0  hl=2 l=  49 cons: SEQUENCE
    2:d=1  hl=2 l=  13 cons: SEQUENCE
    4:d=2  hl=2 l=   9 prim: OBJECT            :sha256
   15:d=2  hl=2 l=   0 prim: NULL
   17:d=1  hl=2 l=  32 prim: OCTET STRING      [HEX DUMP]:9C889D5620DA8407F3C91741F7E5B0EB12D0E2FADFC02234B3AB02EAF6D1860D
```
Now that we have the SHA256 hash from the decrypted signature, let's extract `tbsCertificate` from `google.crt` and calculate SHA256 for comparing:
```
 openssl asn1parse -in google.crt -strparse 4 -out tbsCertificate.bin -noout
```
SHA256 hash of `tbsCertificate.bin`:
```
shasum -a 256 tbsCertificate.bin
9c889d5620da8407f3c91741f7e5b0eb12d0e2fadfc02234b3ab02eaf6d1860d  tbsCertificate.bin
```
As you can see both the hash values are equal, and this confirms that the cert is for sure signed by the intermediate CA and also the cert's integrity is intact. This completes the exercise. However, as I said before, let me give a brief explanation of `tbsCertificate`. Typically, any data has to be presented in some data structure. For certificates that data structure is defined in ASN.1, and on a high level looks like below.

```
Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
        tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
        signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
        signatureValue       BIT STRING  }
```
For signature calculation, the data from `tbsCertificate`, which is encoded using DER (distinguished encoding rules), is used. In one of the steps above when we extracted certificate body, we extracted the `tbsCertificate` for calculating the SHA256.
